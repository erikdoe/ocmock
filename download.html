			Recent changes:
			<ul>
					<li>Added support for quantifiers. Please see documentation section 3.3 as well
						as #302 for details.
					<li>Added preprocessor macros to disable short syntax (in case of clashes). See
						section 9.6. for details.
					<li>Set up dependency management with Carthage. This means that in order to 
						build OCMock from source you must have Carthage installed on your system.
						See https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage for details. You do not need to have
						Carthage installed to use OCMock, and if you want to use OCHamcrest with 
						OCMock you must make OCHamcrest available in your project, using whatever 
						dependency management system you use for your project.
					<li>Added description of mock object to the exception that is thrown when the
						mock is used after stopMocking was called.

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub 
	<span id="cistatus"><a href="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock.svg?branch=master"></a></span>
  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock">https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock</a>

<p>It is built and tests are run by Travis CI. The current status is shown above on the right. If this isn't showing <i>passing</i>, chances are the code is currently not building correctly and we're busy trying to fix it. In all other cases, a local build from source should work.
	
<p>If you want to build OCMock from source, you must have the <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a> package manager installed.
