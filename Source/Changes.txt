Listing of notable changes by release. More detail is usually found in the Git
commit messages and/or the pull requests.

OCMock 3.4.2 (not released)

* Removing dynamically created subclasses when a second mock replaces a mock
  for the same class. (David Sansome)


OCMock 3.4.1 (2017-11-04)

* Added workaround for crashes when mocking NSManagedObjects. As a side effect
  it is no longer possible to verify the invocation of class methods on
  NSManagedObject; see issue #338 for details.
* Fixed a memory leak with andThrow:. (Nick Gillett)
* Fixed bug that prevented protocol mocks from being used with
  invokeWithBlock:. (Christopher McGrath)
* Changed type comparison for structs to match new runtime. (Sylvain Defresne)
* Added polyfill for compilation with 10.9 and lower SDKs. (Sylvain Defresne)


OCMock 3.4 (2016-12-22)

* OCMock now requires iOS 8 as minimum deployment target
* Managed objects can now be mocked (Alan Fineberg, Kyle Van Essen)
* Notifications with a user info dictionary can be observed and verified
  with the macro syntax.
* Now considering structs with unknown names to be the same type as a named
  struct, as long as either the actual definition matches or one of them is
  opaque.

* Fixed bug where a mock would not claim conformance to protocols declared in
  a superclass (Werner Altewischer)


OCMock 3.3.1 (2016-07-01)

* Now throwing an exception when an attempt is made to stub the init method.
* Fixed crash when trying to mock NSArray.

  and verify them from a main thread (Ian Anderson)

* Converting number types to make andReturn more intuitive (Carl Lindberg)
* Macros now silence warnings about unused return values (Gordon Fontenot)
* Added isKindOfClass constraint (Ash Furrow)
* Performance and stability improvements. As a result it is no longer possible
  use verify-after-running to verify certain methods:
  - All methods implemented by NSObject and categories on it
  - Private methods in core Apple classes, ie. the class name has an NS or UI
    prefix and the method has an underscore prefix and/or suffix.


OCMock 3.0.2 (2014-07-07)

* Fixed podspec


OCMock 3.0.1 (2014-07-06)

* Fixed bug that prevented stubs from returning nil

  longer mocked in all subclasses.
* Throwing descriptive exception when attempting to create partial mock on
  toll-free bridged classes and tagged pointers (Mark Larsen)


OCMock 3.0.M2 (2014-05-07)

  to a mock object. Does not work for classes and methods sent directly to

  not as NSInternalInconsistencyException

  Lindberg)

  returns were mocked in partial mocks. (Carl Lindberg)
